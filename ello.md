The people who aren't happy with the Facebook model are generally - if we're honest - dorks. And they are probably dorks who are quite capable of throwing up their own instance of something or other that could do what Ello does in a distributed, non creepy way (whether they can be bothered is a different matter).

The people that actually need a hosted social networking solution, which Ello offers, generally couldn't give a stuff about advertisers and so on, as long as they can continue watching their friends throw cold water over each other.

So it meets nobody's actual need, other than perhaps those that created it.

The one positive thing I have found from using Ello for a few days (other than the crummy UX) is that there's a sense of community among the early adopters. Being able to form small social groups, perhaps private ones, is clearly an untapped need - perhaps particularly for those uber-networkers whose Twitter and Facebook networks are too large to be very personal.
